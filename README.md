Learning TypeScript First Project ToDo List

This project is a simple HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript web application. This is my first project using TypeScript. Users can enter a todo into the input box and click the
add button to add the todo to the todo list. When a user has completed a task they can click the checkbox and that todo list item will be crossed out.

Features
Add New Tasks: Easily add tasks by typing in the input field and pressing enter or clicking the 'Add' button.
Delete Tasks: Remove tasks you no longer need by clicking the delete icon or button.
Mark Tasks as Completed: Mark tasks as done by clicking the checkbox next to the task.

 ## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: Provides static typing to help catch errors during development.
